# Automated Food Warehouse Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize traditional food warehouses by transforming them into fully automated, human-free facilities. Utilizing advanced robotics and intelligent systems, we strive to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and safety in the storage, retrieval, and sorting of food items.

## Our Robot Design

Our core robotic component is a **multi-jointed robotic arm**, as depicted in the provided design. This arm is engineered for precise manipulation and movement within the warehouse environment.

### Key Features of the Robotic Arm:

* **Primary Task:** Pick-and-Place operations for various food items.
* **Mobility:** Capable of flexible movement across X and Y axes (horizontal reach) and the Z axis (vertical reach).
* **Versatile Gripper:** Designed to handle diverse food packaging (boxes, bags, cans).
* **Sensors:** Equipped with vision systems for object recognition, barcode reading, precise positioning, and obstacle detection.
* **Base:** Can be fixed in strategic locations or integrated with an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) or Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) for broader mobility within the warehouse.

## How the Automated Warehouse Works (Simplified Algorithm)

Our system operates through a series of interconnected, automated processes:

### 1. System Initialization & Setup

* **Wake Up:** All robotic units, control systems (computers), and cameras are activated.
* **Self-Check:** Each component performs a diagnostic check to ensure readiness.
* **Map Loading:** The system loads the warehouse layout, including shelf locations and pathways.
* **Standby:** Robots enter a standby mode, awaiting new tasks.

### 2. Receiving & Storing New Goods

* **Arrival:** New food shipments arrive at a designated receiving area (e.g., via conveyors or AGVs).
* **Identification:** Vision systems scan and identify each item (via barcode or visual recognition).
* **Storage Assignment:** The central computer determines the optimal storage location for each item based on factors like category, expiration date, temperature requirements, and size.
* **Robot Placement:** Our robotic arm picks up the item and precisely places it into its assigned shelf location.
* **Inventory Update:** The central computer records the item's new location, updating the warehouse inventory.

### 3. Order Picking & Fulfillment

* **Order Intake:** The central computer receives a new customer order (e.g., a list of items and quantities).
* **Location Pinpointing:** The system identifies the exact locations of all requested items within the warehouse.
* **Robot Retrieval:** The robotic arm moves to the correct shelf, picks up the required item.
* **Internal Transport:** Items are transported (via conveyors or other mobile robots) to a designated packing area.
* **Assembly & Packing:** Robotic arms in the packing area gather all items for the order and place them into shipping boxes.
* **Inventory Update:** The system deducts shipped items from the inventory.

### 4. Management & Maintenance Operations

* **Reorganization:** Robots can autonomously rearrange items within the warehouse to optimize space or facilitate "first-in, first-out" inventory management.
* **Automated Inventory:** Mobile robots with cameras can scan shelves to verify stock levels against system records.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** All robots are equipped with sensors to detect obstacles (e.g., fallen boxes, or humans if present in designated areas). They will slow down, stop, or re-plan their path to ensure safety.
* **Error Reporting:** Should a robot encounter a problem (e.g., failure to pick an item), it immediately reports the issue to the central control system for review.

## Working Envelope (Robot's Reach)

The **Working Envelope** defines the total physical space that our robotic arm can access and operate within.

### 1. Reachable Areas:

* **Full Range:** Any point the arm can touch when fully extended, bent, or rotated around its base.
* **Shelf Access:** Precise points within the storage shelves for efficient item placement and retrieval.
* **Transfer Points:** Locations where the robot interfaces with conveyors or other mobile platforms.

### 2. Unreachable Areas (Outside the Envelope):

* **Beyond Max Reach:** Points further than the arm's maximum extension.
* **Too Close:** Areas too near the robot's base that the arm cannot bend enough to reach without self-collision.
* **Limited Rotation:** For arms not capable of full 360-degree rotation, certain areas behind the robot's fixed base might be unreachable.

### 3. Reachable, but Restricted Areas (for Safety/Operational Reasons):

* **Environmental Obstacles:** Walls, pillars, other machinery, or misplaced items. The robot will detect and avoid these.
* **Safety Zones:** Designated areas where robot movement is restricted or limited (e.g., maintenance zones, emergency pathways, or areas with human presence).
* **Self-Collision Avoidance:** Specific arm configurations that would lead to parts of the robot colliding with each other. These are programmed to be avoided.
